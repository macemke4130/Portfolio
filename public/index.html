                <p><span class="highlight">Hello! My name is Lucas.</span> I am a full stack web developer currently
                    living
                    in Minneapolis, Minnesota. I love working with React and building front and back end applications.
                    Currently, Iâ€™m learning more about GraphQL and how it has the potential to be an industry changing
                    technology.</p>

                <p>From 2005 to 2012 I had an amazing time working in the still budding world of web development.
                    Developers needed to wear many hats as it was then still a relatively new industry. As a result, I
                    needed to learn many technologies all at once.</p>

                <p>For the past 10 years I have been working as a Service Manager and Bicycle Repair Mechanic around the
                    midwest. My career in the outdoor industry has taken me many amazing places and introduced me to so
                    many wonderful and kind people, but during the pandemic of 2020 I knew it was time for a change. I
                    never stopped missing web development, so I decided to get back into the game.</p>

                <p>I enrolled in the Full Stack Developer course at <a href="https://covalence.io/" target="_blank"
                        class="white-link">Covalence</a> and graduated in March of 2021 after 6 months of daily classes
                    and labs. I found that I retained much of the logic skills from
                    my previous career, coding in Javascript was like seeing an old friend again.</p>

                <p>In my free time I enjoy riding and fixing bicycles, brewing coffee in new and interesting ways,
                    camping, photography and coding fun projects.</p>
